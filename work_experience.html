  <h3>
    <p>Work in The Lifeboat Inn, a gastro pub in Courtmacsherry for the past three years</p>
    <p>-As new staff joined, I was asked to take on more of a manager role and thoroughly enjoyed the responsibility</p>
    <p>-Learned valuable skills including the importance of customer relations</p>
    <p>-I was trusted to close up every night which included counting the money in the tills</p>
    <p>-My people skills improved as I was able to take constructive criticism from those higher up than me and also able to mentor newer staff in a professional way </p>
